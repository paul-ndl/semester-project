# Semester Project

## All the steps 

### - Mturk 
- We choose to use Mturk HIT instead of creating a website. We have to create a layout, with the questions etc..., run a python code to deploy it on the platform and to be ready to be completed by the users

### - Next TODOS
- Create Mturk account 
- Use the dataset to ask comparisons using the python code and Mturk API (boto3) 
- Preprocess data to choose the relevant ones to be answered by the users 
- Comparisons or ratings
